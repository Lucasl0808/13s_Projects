# Assignment 1 -"Getting Acquainted with Unix and C"

program called plot.sh that when you run it, creates and opens three pdf files<br>
that contain graphs of the collatz sequence. 

## Compile/Building the program

$make 

$chmod -x plot.sh 

## Run Code

$./plot.sh

## Issues

Takes a long time to run plot.sh because of the long sequence.<br>
If your computer cannot use xdg-open command, you may need to open PDF files<br>
using your computer's method of opening files<br>
(I use  Windows, may not work on Mac)
