# Assignment 5 - Cryptography

Assignment involves making public and private keys using large prime numbers and using these to encrypt and decrypt messages

## Compile/build

make all = creates keygen, encrypt, and decrypt executables<br>
make keygen = only creates keygen executable<br>
make encrypt = only creates encrypt executable<br>
make decrypt = only creates decrypt executable<br>
make clean = removes executables and object files<br>

## Running code

run command: ./keygen -h for more info on running the keygen file<br>
run command: ./encrypt -h for more info on running the encrypt file<br>
run command: ./decrypt -h for more info on running the decrypt file<br>
