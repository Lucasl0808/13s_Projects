# Assignment 5 - Cryptography

Assignment involves making public and private keys using large prime numbers and using these to encrypt and decrypt messages

## Compile/build

make all = creates keygen, encrypt, and decrypt executables
make keygen = only creates keygen executable
make encrypt = only creates encrypt executable
make decrypt = only creates decrypt executable
make clean = removes executables and object files

## Running code

run command: ./keygen -h for more info on running the keygen file
run command: ./encrypt -h for more info on running the encrypt file
run command: ./decrypt -h for more info on running the decrypt file
