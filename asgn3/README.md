# Assignment 3 - Sorting Algorithms
This program implements 4 different sorting algorithms, insertion sort, quick sort, heap sort, and batcher sort. 

## Compile/Building the program

$make sorting

## Run Code

./sorting [ahibq] [n length] [p elements to print] [r random seed]
length default = 100
elements to print default = 100
random seed default = 13371453

## Issues

When I run my sorting executable with the same inputs as the assignment document, it produces the same output but it prints an extra newline.
