# Assignment 7 - Author Identification
This assignment uses Hash tables and bloom filters to identify k most likely authors to a text.

## Compile/Build
(make), (make all), and (make identify) = creates identify executable and all object files.<br>
(make clean) = removes all created object files and identify binary.<br>
(make format) = clang formats all .c and .h files.

## Running Code
run command: ./identify -h for info on how to run identify code

## Issues/Errors to report
The identify runs slowly compared to example binary, where it takes approximately a minute to identify 10 authors using the normal sized database. Issue is addressed more in depth in writeup.
