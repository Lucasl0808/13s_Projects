# Assignment 2 - Numerical Integration

This program uses mathlib.c - a local math library- in order to compute the integral of certain commands.

##Compile / Building the program

$make format

$make 

##Run Code
./integrate [command options -H]

##Issues

My Integrate function is faulty and I was unable to fix it completely, so many of the results are different.<br>
With a large number of partitions, I was able to make the -a, -c, -h, and -i to work (the functions<br>
using only Sqrt and e^x.
